# Lee4You
a personal spambot

Lee4You sends artisanal hand-selected spam to friends, family and online acquaintances of the artist. Based on a body of 11 years of sent messages, the bot generates new messages through an algorithm that churns out new email based on previously sent messages. These unsolicited and possibly unwanted new messages reveal past or present emotions, create new misleading intentions, send information to the wrong recipient, and generally open the artist up to increased scrutiny. The artist has been previously criticized by friends for his high volume of messages and online posts. This bot pushes the boundaries of their tolerance even further.

# Dependencies

* the fish script automates turning on a simple server via python and opening the page to generate text (useful probably only to me, since I run Fish shell instead of bash, and use functions)
